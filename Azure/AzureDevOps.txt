Azure Repos Migration:

- How many Azure Repos do we need to migrate?
- Are you expecting some kind of automation in this migration ? or is it fine if we do it through UI?
- If automation then we can use Azure CLI commands to migrate. This would not be necessary as this is one time we beleive? 
  We can still develop scripts to do this but may be as 
- We would need project administrator permission (at destination azure devops account) to import a repo in the new account. 
- We would need permissions to create a PAT token to migrate. Can we try creating a PAT token and 
  check if we can clone it in some other project in the same account may be?
- Before migrating the actual repo-
  - We are thinking of creating a test repo (cloned version of the actual repo) in the test project in the same account and then we will migrate 
    this cloned repo and check whether all histories are getting migrated correctly.
    Once succeeds, we will do the migration of the repos 1 at a time.
